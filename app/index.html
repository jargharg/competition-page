            * Since its beginning in 1993 Scottish cashmere has remained at the heart of Brora. The mills that make our cashmere were established over 200 years ago and we support local communities, employing Scottish families whose skills have been passed down through generations.
            <br>
            <br>
            At Emma Bridgewater we draw on techniques from over 200 years ago to create our range of pottery. We&apos;re very proud of the fact that we&apos;re one of the biggest employers of potters in Staffordshire, playing our part in the local community.
